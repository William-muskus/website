Welcome back to the Solfate Snapshot, covering the
[latest updates](https://solfate.com/snapshot) throughout the Solana ecosystem!
Over the last week, we’ve seen a major announcement coming out from Solana about
blinks, a new primitive turning on-chain actions into sharable links across the
web, new projects coming out of stealth, and much more!

Here’s the latest from our team at Solfate and the Solana ecosystem:

## Solana Introduces Blockchain Links (Blinks) with Dialect

The Solana Foundation announced the launch of a new primitive known as
blockchain links, or blinks. Blinks allow users to initiate Solana Actions on
any website or app, bringing the Solana experience past traditional dApps and
complex interfaces.

By bringing Solana Actions to any website, this enables developers to create a
wide variety of activations such as:

- Payment requests through text
- Buying NFTs directly on X
- Voting on DAO proposals directly from group chats
- Swapping tokens from social media platforms

> You can think of a blink as sharing a URL that can auto-magically be converted
> into a blockchain dApp widget on any website.
>
> The best part: blinks on desktop web browsers are currently handled by browser
> extensions. These extensions handle fetching the metadata, wallet connection,
> and transaction signing flows. It is all handled by the browser extension.
>
> - [Nick Frostbutter](https://x.com/nickfrosty), co-host of Solfate and core
>   contributor for blinks/actions

Foundation [here](https://solana.com/solutions/actions) or Solfate co-host

## VanEck Files for First Solana ETF in the USA

Global investment Management firm VanEck becomes the first to
[file for a Solana ETF](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2028541/000162828024030249/vanecksolanatrusts-1.htm)
in the United States, announced earlier this week by the Head of Digital Assets
Research [Matthew Sigel](https://x.com/matthew_sigel).

With Bitcoin and Ethereum gaining approval for their ETFs in the USA earlier
this year, all eyes are on Solana to be the next. In the SEC filing, VanEck
outlined that the VanEck Solana Trust would be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange,
pending approval by the SEC.

Sigel’s thoughts on the latest Bloomberg Crypto interview

## Firedancer v0.1 Bug Bounty Announced

With the upcoming launch of the [Firedancer](https://jumpcrypto.com/firedancer/)
validator client, ImmuneFi has
[launched](https://immunefi.com/boost/firedancer-boost/) a new bug bounty
program with up to $1 million dollars in rewards, starting July 10th and ending
August 21st.

## Circle Achieves MiCA Compliance

Circle
[announced earlier this week](https://x.com/circle/status/1807832654538248676)
that they became the first global stablecoin issuer to achieve MiCA compliance.
Through the company’s French license, $USDC and $EURC issuance is now active
under MiCA compliance regulations in the EU.

Part of this milestone is the allowance of Circle Mint to business customers
throughout the EU, giving these businesses access to simple minting and
redeeming USDC and EURC. Out of the current top 10 stablecoins in the crypto
market, $USDC is currently the only one with MiCA compliance, signifying a major
success for stablecoins and the broader crypto industry in the EU.

[Light Protocol](https://x.com/LightProtocol) team
[announced](https://x.com/LightProtocol/status/1804241026334548366) a new
primitive on Solana called ZK Compression, allowing developers to build

on-chain state, drastically reducing state costs while maintaining all the
security and performance features of Solana.

The ZK Compression primitive includes:

- Compressed tokens

## Elmnts Launches From Stealth

A new RWA protocol has
[come out of stealth](https://x.com/elmnts_/status/1806015314142155148) in the
Solana ecosystem called Elmnts, aiming to provide users with access to oil & gas
mineral rights and royalties. By building a commodities tokenization and lending
ecosystem, the Elmnts team is focused on making commodity investing more capital
efficient while offering a separate source of yield outside of crypto.

The Elmnts beta platform will be released over the next few weeks for early
registered users, where they will be able to begin investing in mineral rights
and royalties.
