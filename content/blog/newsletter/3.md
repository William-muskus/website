## Gameshift x Google Cloud

Solana Labs has recently announced a partnership with Google Cloud to bring the
Gameshift platform to their customers, allowing game studios and developers to
utilize Gameshift to experiment with the integration of digital game assets and
user-generated content into traditional Web2 games.

According to a
[tweet](https://twitter.com/GameShift_dev/status/1786020529381445709) by
Gameshift, a number of game studios built on the Google Cloud are interested in
working with digital assets, yet the technical complexities continue to be a
massive barrier to more widespread adoption. By introducing the Gameshift
platform to these studios, developers will have an all-in-one platform to
enhance their games with Web3 experiences.
