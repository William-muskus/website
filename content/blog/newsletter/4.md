### USA Regulatory Updates

The United States House of Representatives passed a bipartisan, pro-crypto bill
earlier this week called
[FIT 21](https://www.paymentsjournal.com/fit21-bill-moves-forward-setting-forth-new-crypto-safeguards/).
FIT 21 aims to provide a more coherent framework for the way digital assets are
treated in the USA, focusing on the tokenâ€™s use as a determining factor in
whether it is a security or commodity. The CFTC would regulate tokens classified
as commodities, whereas the SEC would rule over those deemed as securities.

The House also passed the CBDC Anti Surveillance State Act, banning the Federal
Reserve from adopting any CBDC initiative proposed, or creating a CBDC.

The SEC approved the first Ethereum ETF this past Thursday, signaling a major
win for crypto in the USA! After the announcement, many began to speculate on
the next crypto to land an ETF, with a few guests from CNBC
[mentioning](https://twitter.com/SolanaFloor/status/1793409822643331563) Solana.

### Phantom Acquires BitSki

Phantom released
[an announcement](https://twitter.com/phantom/status/1792903231774834689) on X
earlier this week, covering their recent acquisition of the Bitski wallet and
team! The Bitski acquisition is one step in Phantomâ€™s plan to onboard more users
into the Web3 industry, supporting many ecosystems past Solana. Phantom plans to
utilize the Bitski developersâ€™ skills to create
[rich wallet experiences](/podcast/44), email sign-in, improved security, and
other new use cases.

### Sphereâ€™s Offload Wallet

The team at Sphere recently
[announced](https://x.com/sphere_labs/status/1793691417480704456) the release of
their new feature, the Offload Wallet. The Offload Wallet allows users to
off-ramp their stable coins into fiat through a seamless interface on the Sphere
platform. The wallet allows users to generate a wallet address linked to a bank
account, which then allows you to send stables to receive USD quickly in your
bank account.

### Whales.Meme

Whales Market is a trustless OTC DEX built on Solana, commonly used for selling
and buying upcoming airdrop tokens and protocol incentive points. Their new
offering is whales.meme, a memecoin launch platform with gamified liquidity
bootstrapping. The product works very similar to the popular project
[Pump.fun](https://solfate.com/blog/pump-dot-fun), which recently went through a
major exploit with a former team member.

### Trident Launch

The first open-source fuzzer for Solana programs, written in Anchor, is now
live! [Trident](https://twitter.com/TridentSolana), built by the
[Ackee Blockchain Security](https://twitter.com/AckeeBlockchain) team and
supported by the Solana Foundation, previously won the Marinade community prize
during the 2022
[Riptide Hackathon](https://solana.com/news/riptide-hackathon-winners-solana),
and a development grant from the Solana Foundation in 2023.

The fuzzer will be able to do:

- Automated fuzz test generation for Anchor programs
- Adaptive inputs for better test coverage
- Faster results through guided instruction sequences
- Invariant checks

### Squads Labs Partially Acquires Fibonacci Finance

An [announcement on X](https://x.com/squadslabs/status/1792571949127737426) by
the Squads Labs team outlines their recent partial acquisition of the Fibonacci
Finance codebase. Fibonacci Finance is used by many large protocols in the
industry for its liquidity and risk management services.

Part of the Fibonacci Finance codebase is its risk assessment model for
governance in DAOs. This is the part acquired by Squads, as they look to utilize
the codebase for future offerings from Squads. Apart from the codebase, the
previous Fibonacci Finance Co-Founder
[Shimon Newman](https://x.com/shimon_newman) has joined the Squads team as the
Head of Governance.

### Colosseum's Inaugural Accelerator Cohort

The first group for the Colosseum accelerator has been
[released](https://x.com/colosseumorg/status/1791137438498201658)! The
accelerator program will provide these teams with funding and other various
forms of support as they develop their products, bringing them devnet to
mainnet.

Congrats to the first batch of projects:

- Ore Supply
- Banger.lol
- Urani
- DBunker
- DeCharge
- Torque
- Legends of the Sun
- MeshMap
- Blockmesh
- Rakurai

### BONK Available on Coinbase for NYC Residents
