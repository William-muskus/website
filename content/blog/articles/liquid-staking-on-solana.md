In this article, we’ll be taking a look at the evolving landscape of liquid
staking tokens/derivatives (LSTs/LSDs) in the Solana ecosystem, and highlighting
some of the top LST protocols currently active in the industry. Over the past
few months, we’ve seen a boom of new LST tokens entering the market on Solana,
each operating differently, dishing out different rewards to their users. As the
LST landscape continues to grow on Solana, it is imperative to know how your
LSTs work and how they pay out their rewards.

## Understanding Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) on Solana

Solana utilizes a consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which is run
by multiple validators on the network that verify and secure all transactions on
the blockchain. These validators then allow users would to lock up their $SOL as
collateral, providing network security for Solana in exchange for rewards which
are based off the amount of $SOL staked and the time staked.

Unstaking can also be a long process in the eyes of some users, as entities
looking to unstake their $SOL will have to wait until the end of an epoch, which
is a pre-specified date up to 3 days away. During this time these tokens are
staked, they are illiquid and unable to use for
[other DeFi purposes](https://solfate.com/blog/pump-dot-fun), which brings us to
LSTs.

Liquid Staking Tokens represent a paradigm shift in the token staking realm,
aiming to mitigate the inherent limitations of traditional staking mechanisms.
Unlike conventional staking, which requires users to lock up their tokens in a
network, LSTs offer a liquid form of staked assets. The price of the LST rises
relative to SOL each epoch with Solana inflation rewards being accrued into the
underlying staked SOL in the chosen LST’s stake pool. This liquidity enables
users to trade, lend, borrow, or engage in DeFi activities while still earning
staking rewards.

## Advantages of Utilizing LSTs

The allure of LSTs lies mainly in their versatility and accessibility,
presenting users with a myriad of benefits:

1. Flexibility: By converting staked assets into liquid tokens, LSTs grant users
   the flexibility to actively participate in the DeFi space without sacrificing
   staking rewards.
2. Enhanced Yield: LSTs unlock additional earning opportunities by enabling
   users to capitalize on staking rewards while simultaneously engaging in DeFi
   activities, thereby
   [maximizing yield potential](https://solfate.com/podcast/26).
3. Strategic Management: LSTs empower users to strategically manage their
   staking positions, allowing for dynamic adjustments based on market
   conditions or personal preferences. V

## Exploring the Types of LSTs on Solana

Within the Solana ecosystem, several protocols have introduced distinct
variations of Liquid Staking Tokens, each with its own set of features and
functionalities. With the release of
[Sanctum Infinity](https://learn.sanctum.so/blog/introducing-infinity-enabling-the-infinite-lst-future),
many protocols have been introducing new LSTs into the market.

### Marinade

Entering the industry in early 2021, Marinade was the first entrant into the LST
ecosystem on Solana. Marinade is a stake automation platform for Solana,
offering both a native and liquid staking solution.

#### Liquid Staking (mSOL):

- Permissionless delegation formula for 100+ validators
  - Enhances security & rewards
- LST able for [use in DeFi](https://solfate.com/podcast/42) (mSOL)
- Accrues validator rewards

#### Native Stake:

- Non-custodial solution w/ automated delegation strategy
- No smart contract risk
- Automatically managed and rebalanced staking position with 0 fees

### Jito

In late 2022, the Jito Foundation launched the LSD jitoSOL, which became the
first LSD on Solana to accrue both standard validator rewards and MEV rewards.
In the
[announcement blog](https://www.jito.network/blog/introducing-jitosol-solanas-1st-mev-powered-staking-derivative/)
post by Jito, Anatoly Yakovenko is quoted saying, “MEV is a rapidly growing
business model for blockchains. Jito has a great approach to maximize the
benefits of MEV to the network and minimize the negative externalities of MEV to
the rest of the users and applications running on Solana.”

The jitoSOL stake pool will exclusively delegate its $SOL to validators that run
the Jito-Solana validator client, which helps minimize the negative effects of
MEV. Since its launch of jitoSOL, the LST has gained tons of traction with the
Solana ecosystem, especially following the
[launch of their governance token $JTO](https://www.jito.network/blog/announcing-jto-the-jito-governance-token/)
in 2023.

### Sanctum

Sanctum has become the latest attraction in the world of LSTs on Solana,
following the launch of
[Sanctum Infinity](https://learn.sanctum.so/blog/introducing-infinity-enabling-the-infinite-lst-future).
With the large amount of LSTs launching on Solana, a need for deep liquidity
will be prevalent as we saw in the previous mSOL depeg in late 2023. Sanctum
Infinity acts as a multi-LST liquidity pool which allows users to swap between
any LST within the pool. Sanctum users can become a liquidity provider by
depositing a whitelisted LST into the Infinity Pool, where they receive the $INF
token, accruing both staking and pool rewards.

With the launch of Sanctum Infinity, Sanctum aims to be a scalable solution
helps LSTs access deep liquidity and be interoperable with one another.

In conclusion, Liquid Staking Tokens represent a necessary aspect of the
expansion and growth of DeFi, with staking rewards and liquidity being the main
attraction for users. Across various protocols on Solana, LSTs come in diverse
forms with multiple reward-bearing tokens being accessible in the ecosystem. As
Solana continues to flourish and evolve, LSTs are poised to play a pivotal role
in shaping the future of staking and DeFi in the industry.
