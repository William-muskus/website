A conversation with [Brian Long](https://twitter.com/BrianLong), co-founder of
[Triton](https://triton.one).

Brian has been in the Solana ecosystem since very early days. Pre-mainnet days.
He and his company, Triton One, helped Solana Labs bring up mainnet in
March 2020.

Even to this day, Brian and Triton continue to be active contributors to the
Solana ecosystem. Not only does Triton operate the public mainnet and devnet
RPCs nodes for the public, [Linus Kendall](https://twitter.com/linuskendall)
from Triton is one of the few active contributors of the DAS API and
infrastructure that is vital to compressed NFTs on Solana.

Triton has also been hard at work on improving the Solana RPC Geyser interface
with
[Project Yellowstone](https://docs.triton.one/project-yellowstone/introduction).
In this umbrella project, the Triton team is focused on several aspects of the
Geyser interface to make many improvements. One of those includes Old Faithful,
the effort to put the entire Solana history (200TB+ of data) on the IPFS
network.

This is especially interesting, not only because Solana produces so much data
that grows rapidly every day, but also because it this is being not only
theorized by engineers at Triton and Firedancer, but is also a collaboration
with Protocol Labs (the creators of IPFS and Filecoin). Multiple Layer 1
blockchains working directly together.
