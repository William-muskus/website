A conversation with [Nicholas Chen](https://twitter.com/nixxholas), co-founder
of [SolanaFM](https://solana.fm).

**Alpha alert:** Nicholas Chen shares a screencast of the new version of
SolanaFM. The first public view of it first around! Find the
[video on our YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/bKv2XWjmp7E) here.

SolanaFM is one of the most popular block explorers in the Solana ecosystem.
They are well known for their “visual explorer” that allows even the least
technical people clearly see how tokens and funds flow through a transaction on
the Solana blockchain. Not to mention they have been around in the ecosystem for
longer than most!

Nicholas Chen and the team at SolanaFM have been cooking up some big changes for
the site. After taking in so much feedback from the community, they have have
rebuilt and rewritten most of their website to give an even better user
experience, including more clear “what happened in this transaction” and “why
did this transaction fail” type of information. They have big plans on how to us
machine learning and social interactions within the explorer to take it to the
next level.

In this episode we also talk about:

- how a block explorer makes money
- the future of block explorers, including adding a social element to them?
- screen share of the new version of SolanaFM. One of the first around!

Note: Even though SolanaFM owns a domain TLD for “solana”, they are not a part
of the Solana Foundation or Solana Labs.
