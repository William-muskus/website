A conversations with [Takisoul](https://twitter.com/Milimalism) (aka Dimitris)
about [Dean’s List DAO](https://twitter.com/deanslistDAO) and
[AthensDAOx](https://twitter.com/AthensDAOx).

Dean’s List is a services DAO, meaning their members offer various services to
the broader Solana community including detailed product feedback and marketing
services.

Dimitris shares the overarching visions that the Dean’s List DAO is perusing,
progressing towards a network state of citizens that are able to earn a living
wage. With their current members of about 55 people, each is earning an average
of +$2k a month this year.

We also talk about some of the logistical concerns for how to manage various
aspects of a DAO in the current world. Including who handles payments for
non-crypto payments and who manages the social media accounts for a DAO.
