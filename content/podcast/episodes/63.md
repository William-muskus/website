## Summary

Colosseum recently wrapped up its first accelerator program, which followed its
online hackathon. The accelerator program is a six-week online program that
helps teams push towards a mainnet release and provides support in technical and
non-technical areas. Colosseum also recently closed a $60 million venture fund
and invests $250,000 in each startup that goes through its accelerator program.
The teams in the accelerator program have received feedback on various aspects,
including legal and entity structure, team composition, and early customer
communication. Colosseum aims to evaluate teams based on their ability to ship
quickly and efficiently.

Colosseum is focused on supporting the Solana ecosystem by providing funding,
mentorship, and resources to early-stage projects. They run hackathons to
identify talented teams and provide them with pre-seed funding and support. The
accelerator program helps teams refine their ideas and secure additional
funding. Colosseum also plays a role in educating and convincing later-stage
funds to invest in the Solana ecosystem. They are working on building a
co-founder matching platform to help teams find the right partners. The next
hackathon is scheduled for September 2nd to October 8th.
