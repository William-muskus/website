## Summary

In this conversation, the hosts and HardhatChad discuss the innovative ORE
project, which aims to create a proof-of-work token on the Solana blockchain.
They explore the mechanics of mining ORE, the challenges faced during its
initial launch, and the transition from V1 to V2. The discussion highlights the
importance of accessibility in mining and the project's vision to bring new
users into the crypto space.

We discuss the evolution of the ORE project from its first version to the
second, highlighting key changes such as the introduction of a supply cap and
adjustments to the reward system. They explore the dynamics within the
community, categorizing participants into nerds, speculators, and utility
seekers, and emphasize the importance of liquidity as a central goal. The
conversation also touches on the introduction of staking and mining pools, the
concept of horizontal integration within the ecosystem, and the philosophical
stance on competing with traditional finance through decentralized alternatives.
